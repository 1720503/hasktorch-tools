Very easy to set up; light and sleek.  Love it!	I have had my new fire now for just a few days, but so far, I really like it.  It is slimmer than my old one (2nd gen) and feels nice and light.  I ordered the recommended case with it and it fit beautifully, nice and snug for a very thin sleek look.  However, I have arthritis in my hands and was concerned that if I should drop it, the case might not protect it enough.  That is just for me, it would probably be perfectly adequate for the average person without gripping drifficulties.  I returned the lovely, sleek case and ordered the bulkier Moro case like I am used to.  It is doing a great job.  The new Kindle was very easy to set up and all settings were easy to find.  Definitely recommend.	10 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Schpsych	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1
Perfect as an eReader	My favorite feature of the 2019 Kindle Fire 7 is the “Blue Shade,” easily turned on/off and adjustable via the top drop-down menu. I don’t like bright artificial blue light glaring in my eyes (not good for brain health), so it’s totally awesome Amazon put this in the new Kindle. I got this strictly as an eReader because I wanted something more book-sized than my iPhone XS Max pictured to the left of the Kindle. My Kindle 2nd Gen Paperwhite was too slow for page-turn and browsing the Kindle store. I won’t be downloading other apps or using this as a tablet. I have an iPad for tablet use. This has fast and smooth page-turning and Kindle store browsing. The only improvements I’d like to see are the battery life and for Amazon to add the Libby app to the app store. Pros: -Perfect as an eReader -Size and weight is just right for holding in one hand and the screen is about the same size as a book page -“Blue Shade” for lowering artificial blue light -Page turning and store browsing is fast and easy. Cons: -Could have a better battery life but it’s not terrible. Maybe the Kindle Paperwhite’s battery life spoiled me. -Libby app needed in the Amazon app store.	11 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Samantha R.	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1
Nice size and weight	I really didn't need a new one but wanted the 32 GB.  It works really well so far.  Haven't had any problems.  The battery doesn't seem to last as long as it says but I have only charged it a couple times since receiving it.  Time will tell on that but it does work well.  I inserted a 128 GB mini sd card and works great, just like it should.  The blue color is really pretty and a little different than the 7th generation I have.  The thing I like the most is the 32 GB instead of the 16.  Nice upgrade.	10 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	cat101	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

Great improvement over the previous generation - Same guts as the 8"	Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The Fire 7 has the same guts as the 8 but in a smaller and less expensive package. This is a nice performance boost over the prior generation Fire 7 and it now features an always listening feature if you're invested in the Alexa ecosystem. It can function like an echo device with a display.

iPad to Fire convert.	Update 6/17/19 This thing is a really good value. Its really cool how much this tablet does and how little it cost compared to a iPad. It only focuses on the things you actually need it for. No useless added features like the iPad is packed and cluttered down with. Its perfect for my child. She had a iPad mini. The iPad had no blue light filter. The Fire does. It actually loads faster than the iPad as well. The screen doesn't have glare like the iPad did. Its literally perfect for my child. Parental settings are perfect and easy to access. It does everything I want. It has a curfew setting and others specifically mentioned for child use. I will be buying more for the rest of my household and myself.	12 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Without Lockscreen Ads Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	chris	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1
I love it!	I traded in my black 7" Fire 2015 for a sage 2019, and I am so glad I did.  The main reason I traded in was the battery life wasn't what it used to be, and with the pre-order offer, how could I go wrong?  I received $10 for my trade-in, 25% off a new tablet, plus a $10 app store credit.  The new tablet is double the storage (I still put an SD card in it), a beautiful color and a newer OS. I am a 'The Simpson Tapped Out' game addict, and for a while, I couldn't play as often as I liked on the old tablet because there was an update to the game that didn't jive with older Fire tablets and caused game issues.  I switched over to my Nook Tablet 7" 2016 to play, which was a challenge in of itself.  Thankfully, my new Fire finally arrived on June 17th, and I am back to playing TSTO in full force again!  I play a couple of other games, too, as well as surf the 'net, and read books. I haven't found any issues with battery life or with it getting hot like I have read in other reviews. The only thing I was a little bummed about, which is partly my fault for not really looking and just going by what I read online is that not only did the speaker move, but the headphone jack and volume buttons switched spots, so my Poetic Turtleskin case technically doesn't line up, but for me personally, it's OK because I don't use headphones with this tablet, and I can still feel for the volume buttons.  I also have a Fintie case, which is what I use the majority of the time, and just a little bit of the left volume button is covered by the case, but it doesn't interfere with its use.	21 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	Beckie	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

great tablet, lacks night mode	disclaimer: i haven't been paid to say any of this, it's my first personal experience with a tablet outside apple ecosystem. well... i'm not sure how to start this review but here it goes: DESIGN: looks good, have a headphone jack and micro sd card slot (up to 512gb if i'm not mistaken), half an inch thick, it have a good weight (not too heavy, not too light). OS: when i first started it it was veeeeery slow, updating for like 20min straight, and then it started and was still slow... i assumed it was still updating in the background so i was patient and waited a lil bit longer... eventually i started using the OS and it is kinda slow but at the same time it isn't, it's a strange feeling but not unpleasant (apple ecosystem user here) so i was aware that i wasn't using an apple device and it was just fine.... it also have its own app store (most apps for social media available) and quite other amazon services like kindle, instant video, amazon music, etc., and i love it! HOWEVER (and this is a big however) it has no true night mode, it have an amber filter to apply, the "blue shade" to reduce the blue spectrum from your device, this feature doesn't eliminate the blue filter but it adds an amber one and it's beyond annoying, i have a night mode on every device i own and this tablet kinda doesn't help to the cause of reducing the eye strain, but it's ok, i just lower (maybe more than normal) the contrast in order to reduce the light of the tablet... if they can make a true night mode upon software update it will be beyond amazing! other than that issue, i love this tablet, i can't even complain... kindle books look great, netflix movies look very good, amazon store experience it's amazing, everything it's just there... i didn't have any previous gen like many people, it's the first one for me and i like it very very much. at first the software can be a lil bit confusing but after a few hours exploring you'll realize 2 things: 1. for the price you pay, you'll have what you need for leisure and ocasional social media use and video, it's more than sufficient including some heavy content and store from amazon which is good, and 2. you  don't need google play (at least i don't need it) for the point 1, it has everything! (at least what i need) i see what amazon tries to "sell" us and it's good, it's well taken care of and i wouldn't ask for more... i'm deeply grateful that this investment has paid by itself.	19 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	M.

DO NOT DEREGISTER AND DON’T BELIEVE MOST OF WHAT TECH SUPPORT SAYS OR ASKS YOU	While I am happy with my new Kindle I am extremely angry that if you have an old one that used to belong to someone else the supposed tech support people fail to understand that as the person who did not initially own the older kindle and has no access to the password for the email attached to that kindle, they still told me to go ahead and DEREGISTER when I had repeatedly asked are you sure thats a good idea? And telling them again & again I have no way of signing in without a password. I was told tjat wouldnt be a problem. Well guess what? ITS A PROBLEM!!! The person that used to have the kindle before me could no longer access the password due to no longer knowing it, was unable to change it and even though they set up a different email account was told that wasnt enough. I, myself spent a whole day with tech support and some woman who’s JOB is to HELP, she couldnt  stop eating long enough to pay attention to what she was being told! She wamted to speak with the previous owner of the kindle and even that wasn’t enough. All I wanted was to be able to access ALL of my ebooks to transfer them to my new Kindle.  I ended up with a Kindle I can longer use to do anything with except use Safari. The new kindle fire is very light in weight, I didnt get an 8 or above just a 7 inch again, sage green color on back. IF I can get the issue fixed I’ll have better to say about Tech support and more about the new kindle.	22 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	Robyn Facchiano	5.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1
An amazing refresh of the base Fire tablet at an affordable price	Original review (June 9, 2019) and three updates placed at the end of the original review (June 10, 2019, June 14, 2019, and June 21, 2019, respectively). ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 9, 2019 (5/5 stars) UPDATED REVIEW: June 21, 2019 (4/5 stars) For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section). This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations. Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience. -THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well. - AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better. - Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model: --- Display size remains the same --- PPI remains the same at 171 --- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM. --- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone) --- Size specifications remain the same --- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty) - Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017. ---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB). --- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version. --- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging. --- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available. --- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version. --- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams) --- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page). --- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black. - Technical specs and other details: --- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm). --- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles. --- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback --- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB --- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases. --- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams --- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so. --- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7) --- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera --- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor --- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life --- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used) --- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication.  No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. --- Bluetooth 4.1 LE --- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker. - Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series): --- No HD video viewing available --- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out) --- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker) --- Sound quality is average --- Amazon’s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store. --- Amazon’s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.). --- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced). --- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker. -Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review. - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) --- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units. - Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model): --- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours) --- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches) --- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback) --- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI) --- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8) --- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM) --- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours), --- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker) --- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera) --- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g) --- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)] --- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB). --- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage) --- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99) --- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point) ** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case). - Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list) --- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.” --- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk --- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. --- Ability to read Kindle books. --- Ability to read the news using Washington Times --- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. --- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc. --- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store. - Testing: Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward. - Saving money on purchasing the Fire: --- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card. --- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet. --- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers.. --- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire. --- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item. --- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point. -Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use). - Conclusion: To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point. - UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8 I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours). - UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited - Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period) --- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish! --- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.” --- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends). *FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time. UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and Software Some customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it. Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.

I can finally recommend the Fire 7	I having been buying the smaller Fire tablets (7 inch) since the beginning and I can now recommend to buy this tablet. I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more "cheap"). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the "page curl effect" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a "star" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!	10 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Rick	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Amazing tablet for the price point.	Overall, I highly approve of this tablet for it's price point. If you're looking for something affordable and use for the basics, this tablet is great! So far I've just done some basic browsing and downloaded some games. It's sleek and light weight, and I absolute love the color! The issues are still to be expected for a new release - connection to WiFi is unstable, it runs super slow at times (I do have apps downloaded, however I do have the 32gb version, and only have a total of 6 extra apps download as of today (06/12/2019), and honestly the ads on the lock screen are super annoying (which may be user error on removal from my end, I have not dove deep into the settings quite yet.) The tablet arrive with 60% battery on the 10th, and that 60% have survived through today. I'm excited to see how long the battery lasts when I'm using it more as I plan on taking it on vacation with me in July. As time goes on, I'll update this review if things change or I find more issues. For it's price though, I can't make too many complaints. Amazon did well with this tablet, and I'm happy with my purchase overall.	12 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Plum Style: Fire 7		Yes	Effy	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
why I love and hate my kindles :)	I really love my kindle (or should I say kindles) I am a avid reader (a book in a day or 2) it is always with me. but Ill explain why only 4 stars my first kindle husband bought as a present from box store in April of 2012, (NOTE w warrenty) and I was hooked.. THAT original Kindle, was replaced for a bad charge port 8/12 (4 months old, and when replaced you get a refurbished model) and replaced again 4/2013 (8 months) and last time in 11/2013 (7 month) didnt think they'd replace so I bought another 11/2013 and packed it away when they did replace for third time. When I started using the one bought and put away, it lasted until 7/2017, that one the screen got smashed, so I had to order another 5/2018. come to the middle of June 2019 (again..sigh) so I was determine to see if the 4-5 I had could be reused...oh the 2nd one that wasnt a replacement from 2013 that lasted till 2017, that is the one I am currently using, unknown to me, my husband ordered another from Amazon, this i the one I am reviewing. it will be put away until the 2013 model dies again.. My point is spend the extra 10-12 bucks for square trade protection plan, its worth it. Amazon knows there is a problem with charging ports, and unless you have extended warrenty its only covered for 90 days. and take care of it, as I said avid reader, I love amazon and my kindle, it gets knocked around on my night stand, in car (read on work breaks) ect. and do your research, google bad charge ports for kindle, there are complaints but also ALOT of suggestions for how to repair yourself. even with the problems I have had, I always try to repair or buy new because I have ALOT of reading to do :) I hope this helps someone else	06 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Janet Gambino	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Same Fire with Alexa Hands-free added.  Love it!	I love my Fire.  Upgraded from a 5th gen.  It's just the right size to carry around for reading or playing simple games in waiting rooms, etc.  It travels with me and I use it for everything I would otherwise have taken a laptop for.  I use the alarm when I'm traveling.  Much nicer than a phone.  Easy to keep in touch with family even when I'm overseas. Hands-free Alexa is interesting if you have the tablet in a room with a Dot.  She can get a little confused. I download movies and shows to watch on a plane, as well as books to read on vacation.  My daughter and grandson also have Fire tablets.  He is very attached to his (literally).  Since he doesn't have a phone, he uses Instagram to talk to his girlfriend.  The blue filter for use before bed is very effective.  I can still read, but can fall asleep easily afterward.  Hardly use my kindle anymore. Put an SD card in and books, movies, photos and some apps download to the card, saving internal space. I've never used up an SD card. If you have prime, your family can access your library with your permission.  It's great that I can see the apps my grandson downloads and that he can't order anything that costs money without my permission. Cons: There are apps you can't delete, even if they are inappropriate for you.  I'm a grandma, so I'll never need "Free Time".  Prime Video and games button are redundant and I never plan on using Newsstand.  These just take up space. Others you can't delete:  Goodreads, Audible, Docs, My Videos, Photo Importer, and those you'd expect:  Shop Amazon,  and Amazon Offers. You must delete open tabs in Silk or it will open everything you left open. The cons are no big deal.  I don't even mind having to swipe away the ad screen when I open the Fire.	27 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Plum Style: Fire 7		Yes	Marji	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Ok tablet.  Great for the price	Better than I expected.  I was going to get the 32 fb option but the 16 fb option was available to ship sooner. Excellent deal from prime day!  A majority of my apps were found in the App Store.  I loaded Netflix, Hulu, Hallmark Movies Now, the CW app, CW seed, Pluto, crackle, Tubi, app for my tablo, YouTube, Roku remote app, abc news, nbc news, cbs news, cnn, Washington post, huffington post, my local news stations, fb app and fb messenger, Pandora. I heart radio, Spotify, you version of the Bible, ancestry.com app, family search, scanner radio app, national weather service radar.  It came with all the amazon apps for your books, movies, music, etc.  it came with a clock, calendar, calculator, map, camera, Alexa, and the silk browser.  I could not find the app for my 23andMe dna, my heritage app, Snagfilms, and a few others of my regular apps but I logged on to my stuff from the silk browser.  I looked to see if I could find Firefox to download but I didn’t.  I was already aware that I wouldn’t been getting google apps like hangouts or chrome.  I haven’t tried the tricks yet to get the google stuff yet.  So far I dont need anything except maybe the hangout app.  A friend and I call and video chat that way. I bought a 128gb microSD card to go with it and some of the apps will move to the card but some don’t.  I have used all but 7 fb after looking everything and updates so I’m worried about that.  Still a good deal for 29 dollars on prime day.  I also previously used a 128gb iPad mini 4.  Right now I can’t get I to my iPad and I need my brother to work on it so this fire tablet is to just get me by and to take to work.  I won’t worry about it because I didn’t spend a lot on it.	25 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Stacie	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Get the 8" Fire for extra $10	I've had the new 9th Gen 7" Fire for about 5 days. I own a 10"...and I needed a replacement for my old 8" that died (refuses to charge--not even a year old -- #Amazon please take notice) There is a BIG difference in Speaker Sound Quality vs the 8" unit.  Not even close! In addition, the speaker location lives in a place where you are apt to cover with your hand while you are holding the unit.  A strangely poor design. Everything else seems to be fine...I cranked up the default font size to compensate for the smaller screen. I was unable to "auto-restore" the new unit...but was able to get all of my apps/photos/etc from the cloud without too much issue. I bought a nice generic case for about $10 (on EBay). Bottom Line:  Buy the 8" Fire for $59!!  No contest.	11 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	BryanElliot	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Great price, does what I need it to	I have a gen 1 kindle fire that I love. It has finally gotten to were it just won't charge (it's the charging port). I figured after almost 9 years it was time to upgrade. To be fair I paid 1/3 of what my original kindle fire cost. The quality of this one is ok. I bought it to read books and watch some Netflix while I'm on the treadmill. For my purposes this works great. If you are looking for basic this is a good choice. No play store, but you have Amazon apps to choose from, they have a decent enough selection. I like that it has a micro SD slot for up to 512g and you also have cloud storage as well. It connected to my wifi no problem. Set up was easy and quick. Remember when purchasing this item it's not a powerhouse, my cell has a faster processor. But for some light shopping, a bit of internet surfing, reading some books, and watching a movie, it will work just fine.	17 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Amazon Customer	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Great Tablet for Those on a Tight Budget	Well I have to say that the Amazon Fire Tablet 7" is well worth the fifty bucks I paid for it. It's a great little tablet for the price annnd it comes with ALEXA! Now in order to get it for fifty dollars you're gonna have to put up with a few ads but they are very unobtrusive and in no time at all you won't even pay attention to em. Now you can get the 7" Fire Tablet without ads but you'll have to fork over an extra twenty but hey,to each his own right? The display is crisp & clear enough and the touch responsiveness is on point (no pun intended). But if your expecting to be wowed by the speakers well you need to tone down your giddyness a bit in this department. The speaker consists of seven small holes that are located on the lower left hand corner; now if your holding he tablet in portrait mode and you're holding it with you left hand, then your gonna be covering up the speaker but on the bright side if you cup your hand while holding it this way your hand acts kinda sorta like a megaphone 😃. Anyway, the speaker is the only gripe I have about this tablet and it does have Bluetooth so you can connect it to a better speaker, I use a Thumper 808 with mine and I love the crap out of it 😊. Look folks, for fifty bucks you can't beat the quality, durability or features of the 7" Fire Tablet. If your trying to find something comparable to the IPad mini or a Samsung Galaxy tablet, this ain't it. But if you're looking for a great little tablet thats gonna provide you with hours of entertainment with decent battery life and your on a tight budget...then come on in brothers and sisters the water is fine 😉.	13 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Arthur Hall	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1
Nice upgrade to the previous model but...	...the battery life is horrible compared to the Kindle Fire 8. A full battery after reading for an hour or two a day will have 54% battery life the next day. No gaming, no movies, no surfing the web. I purchased this solely to read books and because of it's size is easier to carry when traveling. It's the same experience as in reading and purchasing books. If you've used one Kindle, you'll know how to use this Kindle Fire. Other than the battery life, it's a good device.	15 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Hawkstv	4.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1

Disappointed at first, hopeful at the improvements.	I received this kindle as a gift, and as I was downloading ebooks, it just shut off. I tried doing a soft reset, a hard reset, and even tried putting the kindle back to factory settings. It did not work. I called customer service, and they said they would send me a replacement. Somehow there was issue after issue, where I could no longer be sent a replacement, and they would not allow me to send the kindle back in for a gift card. First it was something with my card, and then my address, despite having used both before. They also wouldn’t, for whatever reason, allow me to return the kindle. Finally, after days, far too many phone calls, and a review, they made an “exception” for me, and agreed to send a return label. They also sent a new kindle. The new kindle currently works well, and hopefully it will stay that way. However, I’m a little frustrated with the whole process, although I am mostly happy with the end result. It would have been best for the kindle to work properly from the get go, and I still can’t comprehend why returning the kindle was such a difficulty.	15 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	whitney	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1
Grow up Amazon and stop blocking Google play.	Let me start by saying I am not expecting iPad performance from a $50 tablet.  I use (or want to use) these as fancy all in one remotes for my home AV setups (receiver, TV, blu-ray, etc.) as well as (when I can get it working) my Samsung Smartthings hub and z-wave light switches. This is a nicely made well thought out value for money tablet.  Fine for reading armchair web browsing etc. But... Battery life seems quite short. Performance is a little slow. The worst of all?  The trade war between Amazon and Google makes it virtually impossible to download apps from the Google play store.  There is a way but it is quite contrived. And despite what Amazon might say, not all the apps I wanted were available from Amazon.	23 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Darren H	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1

Too many ads!	The new Fire tablet works well overall if you can get past all of the advertisements and Alexa constantly prompting you to buy this and subscribe to that for only $xxx dollars a year! Good sound and video quality, though queuing up a video takes a bit of time. Battery tends to drain fairly quickly. I’ll be switching back to my way overpriced iPad but happy to do so since ever other click doesn’t want me to spend more money. Basically if you want an inexpensive tablet to read, browse online and watch videos this may be the product for you.	13 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Amber	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1
App Limitation	For the price it is a good Tablet. It looks nice, lighter than it looks, and very useful when you are cooking. ( looking at recipe / bigger screen makes easier to read while setting up ingredients. Was using phone before) The Only issue I have is the limited amount of apps I could use / download on it. Since it is an Amazon product, you can only use Amazon approved apps. You can not download from the Apple App store (which makes sense), but you can not download from Google Play store either.  There are some Apps / Games that I wish I can use on this Tablet, unfortunately Amazon doesn't have them. I still like this Tablet, just wish for more app access.	13 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Quan M.

Hardly any difference from my older Fire 7 Table!	I actually returned this item as I saw no difference in this new edition versus my older edition. Just thought Newer Edition Fire 7 Tablet would be so much better. Improved and faster etc. And at first I was excited about this New Edition. However, after receiving it and checking it out I found very lacking in any improvements at all. Only change I saw or could determine was that it was built differently from my older Fire 7. My opinion is if your older Fire 7 Tablet is working OK no need to buy this newer edition.	27 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	john f. clifford	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1
Temper expectations for best results	Performance: Feels very sluggish - was expecting somewhat similar performance to my older 2015 Fire 7 but this actually felt slower on the same latest version firmware. May improve in future updates but this is a major uncertainty. Battery: Drains to 0% in 4 days standby, 2 days passive use (15 minutes every few hours), or 4-5 hours active use. Weight: Very light, it feels lighter than my old 2015 Fire. Value: At $40, this is a decent value as long as you manage expectations. I received 25% off for trading in my old tablet and including the trade in value, my total cost came out to $30. There was also an additional $10 appstore credit promised for pre ordering but I have yet to see this reflected in my account. This tablet is best when not utilizing any data-heavy or graphic-heavy applications as it will be a major slowdown. Great as a on-the-go video player, ebook reader, and general tablet for trips where you wouldn't want to lose your primary tablet.	16 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Billy Liu	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1
Depending On Your Use, This Might Not Be For You	For starters, I love Amazon.  Who doesn't? And my old Ipad is starting to finally kick the proverbial dust after years of abuse.  The battery is finally starting to take forever to charge, and there's lagging issues due to it being so old, and the updates are just killing it more.  But it is still beloved to my four year old, who somehow commandeered it. All that being said, I was so excited when it finally came in!  It looked awesome, was a little different with the controls all at the top, including the volume, power, charging port, and headphone jack, with the speaker not at the bottom of the device but on the left side, which was an odd placement I thought after I put a case on it, and I typically hold it where the speaker is located.  The opposite side close to the top is the slot for an SD card.  There are no front buttons as it's fully touchscreen also. I already knew before going in that you could not use Goggle Play, although I'm sure there's a way to get around it.  I basically wanted to use it for videos for both myself and my daughter, games, and the occasional book and web browsing.  Now, keep in mind we have super fast Internet.  When I first started the Fire tablet, there was the required set up process, which didn't take long, just the basics such as adding wifi, signing in, etc.  I did purchase the tablet with "special offers" as it did not bother me to see the ads on the lock screen.  Once on, it was a pretty nice setup, especially for those that are already "in" with Amazon as it shows a Home screen with my recent book/audiobook purchases up top, then all my apps below it, the next page shows Books, and includes some books from my library as well as recommendations below it, Videos is next, followed by Games, Shop (which was so odd as it shows things I've looked at), Apps, Music, and Newsstand. So basically, if you do a lot of Amazon shopping, listen to Audible as well as Amazon Music, watch Amazon videos, and read Kindle books, then this might be for you. If you don't use Amazon that frequently, then I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a regular tablet, one that is not hardwired for their Amazon customers. Now in my personal use, because I do use a lot of their services, I do like it.  But it's also dang annoying.  I suppose it's coming from having owned Apple devices, and Samsung devices that I find this tablet to lag tremendously.  Actual startup from the time you press the power button takes about 40 seconds to pop on.  Not too shabby, but there is a lag from opening the lock screen to opening apps that isn't apparent in a good quality Apple or Samsung product.  And let's not forget the horrible lag from going from one profile to the next.  It takes forever, and at this point, I finally erased the profile I set up for my daughter. I loved that I would be able to limit her usage as we already do that, but in this way she couldn't even get on without my code.  You can download what apps they can use, and manage their profile fully, which is great!  But on the flip side, I can't seem to figure out how to get back to my profile without shutting the whole thing down or restarting it as it opens right to her page versus the lock screen when opened back up. And as I previously stated, you can use the Amazon apps, but there aren't as many apps as can be found in Apple.  There are some I love to use, and they do not have them available at all, which sucks.  Amazon's browsing is called Silk, and works fine, although I still find it slow with fast Internet.  The quality of the screen and the battery are two other issues that are definitely cheap and sub par.  The screen quality on browsing has the slightly blurred look of a cheap android tablet. Words are ok, such as in an article, but pictures are blurred, and even video is not that clear or crisp.  The battery is also very weak I've found.  I've had my phone on since six this morning, and turned the tablet on around 10 this morning.  My phone, which I've used all morning to make calls, text, watch a few video's, look at FB, browse, etc., is down to 76% battery.  The tablet, which I've used to download four apps and had maybe about 20 minutes of use and has been on standby is down to 75%.  The battery does not last long at all.  If you watch even a few videos on the tablet, you can easily watch the percentage slowly bottom out. The camera is what you would normally find on a cheap tablet, and I wasn't expecting much nor did I get much in return.  The kindle portion is fantastic, and I can read easily on it, but I also own a Kindle, and I prefer that to this as the glare is greatly reduced even though you can change the page color and brightness of the screen.  I do like seeing the book covers in color though, and maps or things throughout the book that would normally be colored, but otherwise it is still nice to be able to read on it well.  Alexa works totally well, and it's easy to use, and I like the fact that you can use Alexa to play some games.  My daughter is fascinated with her. In all, this is an okay basic entry tablet that's good for watching videos, and is more tuned towards Prime members who have a lot of Amazon features already.  I'm going to keep it as I wanted something cheap for my youngest daughter to watch videos and keep her occupied, and for my occasional browsing.  But if you want a crystal clear screen, no lag, and better selection of apps, then I would definitely recommend going with an Apple or different Android device.	26 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Odessa	3.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1
Gave up after a month.	I kept trying, and despite re-setting the phone multiple times (the only fix the so-called "help" line recommends) the bluetooth was always unstable. Amazon was unable to replace, so I just returned the Fire 7  and got an unlocked Android phone instead for $20 more. It's a big improvement: no need to fiddle to get the Google Play store, performance is both faster and more stable for every task, and the screen although smaller is much brighter and more crisp. The Fire 7 is a mistake--I recommend avoiding. Initial review: I bought this as a media center for the kitchen, and it will work barely well enough-- for 50 bucks. Here are the problems that are happening within 24 hours: - Bluetooth pairing with Bose headphones is unstable--static-y or just randomly cut off - poor battery life--down more than 30% in about an hour. It gets hot. - screen smudges super-easily--a problem in a kitchen - Amazon help system is a joke--clicks lead in a circle, and there's no findable content on any of these issues Of course I'm not surprised that the experience is worse than my iPad, but I am surprised that it's so much worse than my cheap Android phone.  On the plus side, adding the Google Play store turned out to be easy, so I can use my music account there.	11 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	fol	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Didn't fulfill a very simple brief	I wanted to like this tablet for a simple use case, but alas no go, and I've returned. I'm invested in the Apple ecosystem, but I've also owned Nexus/Pixel phones.  I have an old ipod nano which has served me well as a "night-time" device, leaving my iphone to charge elsewhere overnight. However, as my only non-wifi connected device I wanted a cheap replacement that would allow me to refresh my podcasts without a cable, install a few basic apps, outlook, facebook, and Netflix, and a small form-factor, no bigger than 7 inches. What could possibly go wrong. Ugh! I can't recommend this tablet for several reasons: - terrible App store. Awful games and not much else compared to the Apple store and Google Play. - very laggy and non-responsive in general. - buggy, wallpaper would randomly reset to a different image from the available collection. - screen seemed to have a strange surface, plasticky, almost like it had a built-in screen protector. I would say if you're not invested in Apple get one of the many available Android tablets around $100 that supports Google Play, or get a refurb Apple iphone/ipad. It costs a little more, but you'll skip the daily frustrations. I did like the hardware form factor, shame about the software.	17 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Fiona Lindberg	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Loaded with Ads.	Truthfully my Kindle  Fire Gen. 3 was a better machine.  I has a much heavier build, longer battery life and it didnt spam me with ads at every swipe.  They have { Amazon} gone over board with their self promotion.  I like the location of the buttons and the feel.  Screen is sharp, but aps don't load as fast as my Gen. 3....prob. because 0f all the bloatware in the Gen 9.  And....And...no other browser except for silk...ugh.  Firefox for the win ..is no longer available.  Maybe I can re gift this.	20 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	LarrySmola	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Special offers = annoying ads every time it turns on!	$50 for a tablet sounds good, but the ad that pops up each time you turn the tablet on are quite annoying.  They don't go away on their own after a certain period of time; they're the kind you have to click out of.  Doesn't sound like such a special offer to me.  I went online and turned off the offer notification, only to be charged an extra $15 WITHOUT prior notification (or any notification for that matter, so beware!).  It might make sense to buy one of their kids versions at a discounted rate, say, around Black Friday, as those don't have all of these annoying ads and you actually have an adult profile for that tablet too, which is the same as what you'd have from this.  My daughter's kids version has been very reliable and I can switch over to the adult version any time I want to use it or make changes.  So, I guess I'd say that the fire tablet with special offers isn't worth it.  Get the kids version, pay for the version without the offers, or find a different tablet altogether.  Hope this helps!	07 Sep 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	Shawesome	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
No Mic on ANY Keyboard, Limited Apps	First the Good: I loved the sage green color and I've never seen that anywhere else. Also, the size was perfect for reading in bed. I wanted to try the 7 inch because my phone is too small, and my 10 inch tablet is too heavy to hold up and read while I'm trying to fall asleep, now that I'm older. So I learned that a 7 inch size is perfect for this function. That's where the pros end for me. The cons: 1) While the Fire does allow you to increase font size on web pages, it does not allow you to increase font size of tablet's menus so I still had to squint and strain, even with my glasses on. Not designed well for middle-aged people or older. 2) You are forced to use Silk Browser which has an ugly orange logo. (All the Amazon apps are ugly orange and black, or orange and white, great for Halloween but...) I tried to download Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, but none are offered through Amazon's appstore. 3) Most of the apps I used are not available through the Appstore either 4) But the  biggest reason of all for my decision to return the device after 24 hours of use, is because after downloading several different keyboards that all claimed to have a microphone, and not being able to find it anywhere, I finally caved and contacted device support and was told that the builtin microphone on the Fire is not a working feature of any keyboard. It is only intended to be used with Alexa. So, as a person who likes to walk and talk (jotting down notes as I speak and pace) and a person who likes singing karaoke through apps that can't be downloaded to this device, I learned that the Fire is not the right tablet for me. It's too bad, because I would have liked to have kept it but it needs more customization options, more app availability, and a mic. Users aren't really allowed to control much on this device. Oh one other thing I don't like is how it began automatically downloading TV shows I didn't ask for on day 2. And it was constantly showing me things to shop for on Amazon.	04 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	Just_Me	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
I'd suggest buying the 8 or higher...	So, I bought this on the fly when my daughter accidentally crushed the screen on her Fire 8. It was considerably cheaper and my thought was that I'd just saved a ton of money for just a little smaller screen (think Iphones and the slight differences in each level) Boy was I wrong. These tablets are worlds apart! From smaller screen to significantly decreased battery life and tons of things in between (constantly getting "stuck" and having to completely reboot, touch screen not working properly, poor sound quality, etc.) I am highly disappointed. Don't do like I did being cheap, swing the extra for the 8 or higher. You'll be happier in the long run.	16 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Ms. Tam	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Not what I was expecting	On the first night I got it, the whole thing froze up while I was using the Kindle App.  I restarted it and everything seemed normal.  Four days later it started freezing up every so often with lines going down the screen vertically. Nothing I did would shut it off or restart it.  A few minutes later the screen would go black and the Amazon logo would appear.  This has been randomly happening ever since.  The battery life when using the Kindle App is poor especially since it is a brand new device having only Five (5) days of use. ---So I finally contacted Amazon about the issue I was having. The tech assured me a factory reset would solve my freezing issue. I contacted him on Thursday morning after the millionth freeze and restart. It worked the rest of Thursday and Friday. On Saturday morning it began the freeze and restart issue again. I contacted Amazon. Guess what the tech had me do, another factory reset. 🤦🏾‍♀️	05 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Plum Style: Fire 7		Yes	Kindle Customer	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
No customization possible, nothing but ads	I've bought Fire tablets before, they're a less expensive option for my kids, but the most recent one will not allow me to remove a single pre-installed app. I payed for 16GB storage on this but it's a misleading ad since they fill your tablet with things you won't use and advertisements. I was going to get 2 more at the price they were at, but I may never buy a Fire again (for the same reason I never bought Kindle after 1). Limitations on content, only amazon apps. This tablet forces you to use it at face value, and takes away your ability to customize, if you want an ad loaded OS with the least user friendly UI I've seen in decades this is the tablet for you. Next time it's a budget Android for the kids and I'll stick to paying a little more to Samsung for a tablet, not a sales ad.	22 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Rex Knauff	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Drop Wi-Fi connection when using Bluetooth	I bought this to replace a my 3 year old 7 inch 5th generation Fire with very little storage. The extra memory and additional sd card storage is nice, the touchscreen is more responsive ,( it's tacky feeling), and it turns on quicker. On the negative side, when I use the bluetooth to listen to an audio book and cruise the internet it drops the Wi-Fi connection after about 10 minutes and the only way to reacquire it is to turn  the Fire off and then on again. The old 7-inch didn't have this problem. Using earbuds that plug in doesn't cause this problem. Also the battery life isn't any better then the old one, about 3.5-4 hours if you are doing anything other then reading a downloaded book.	03 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Diane 54	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
never again	yikes....these are really rough. even for its price. i bought these for my kids. they can barely play games on here, they are 8 and 6, so its not like they are playing crazy games. the battery life is subpar. the touch screen responsiveness is just awful. the ads are EVERYWHERE too but i hear there are work arounds for that. the screen is relatively sharp. I have this issue of trying to touch something on the boarder of the screen and it not registering. i find myself having to press 2-3 times for it to register what i'm tapping on. they can play a couple of hours of games and maybe squeeze some cartoons in, and its dead. the 7 year old samsung tablets i had them on prior lasted a lot longer. that was only 90 bucks.....you get what you pay for. go for the better model, trust me.	15 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Jeff Kelly	2.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=1
Seemed like it was possessed.	This kindle worked well for a few hours and then all of a sudden it started to search the internet on it's own.  This is for my 8 year old daughter because her old kindle was not working.  This kindle really scared my child.  She would play a game and something would control the game.  We would watch it change the settings on it's own and move from ap to ap.  When the kindle was locked something kept trying to access my contacts, and unlock my kindle!!  It would change the time and change to a different alarm.  I contacted amazon and they were not helpful, because nothing worked..  I had to factory restart it twice and it kept going back to controling itself on it's own.  Finally I just had to return it because it because there was no way to use it.  Amazon needs to make a product that works.	11 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	C.

Don't get if you want things like Google play	I'm not a fan. It doesn't hold an internet connection well AT ALL and I hate how limited the device is. I'm sure it's mostly my fault for not reading that the fire tablets are only exclusive to Amazon apps so you can't use any apps from Google play or anything, but in the part of the description I read it said games. I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services. If you are okay with only watching movies, TV and reading, this may be okay for you. Not sure about the internet connection though, my boyfriend's tablet (Lenovo) doesn't do that.	10 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Twilight Blue Style: Fire 7		Yes	Cassie	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
This is not ready for prime time	I am surprised by how bad this product is given the overall decent quality of Amazon products.  The screen is unresponsive and freezes.  Kindle books I purchased are inaccessible from this device no matter what I do to open them even though they show up on the kindle app.  I cannot delete apps that I don’t want even though I am supposed to be able to do so.

Waste of Money	I have purchased 5 of these tablets over the years for my kids that are younger than 10. Each time when I am setting it up, and ask myself why I bought another one. I will not be purchasing another amazon tablet again, and here is why. There are some PROS to this tablet. They are cheap so I can buy one for all my kids to use / The battery life is really good / They are good enough hardware wise to run pretty much whatever kids games my kids download / That's where the pros end. CONS - The cons of this device far out weigh the pros. This tablet displays enough ads to choke a horse / The tablet is very slow. every few months I have to factory reset it when it is slows to a crawl without any indication as to why / Storage is low at 16GB. I added a 64GB sd card to each tablet. however this does not solve the issue, because in order for the SD card to be effective, the app has to be SD card compatible which only 10% of them are. So most apps will remain on the tablet with no way to transfer them to the SD card  / The home screen is full of garbage, and useless apps and features that my kids will never use, and just ends up confusing them. There is no way to clean the home screen up. My kids won't use GoodReads, or exclusive offers, or Shopping, or New Stand, or any of the other 45 home screens chalk full of crap. It would be nice if I could disable those home screens and just have ONE main home screen with their apps on it. If I want to buy them a book, or if they are dying to read the latest editions on new stand, then that should be inside the amazon app, not plastered on the home screen.  My kids also don't use email, so I went in to uninstall that, you can't. to free up resources and storage, I wanted to uninstall email, weather, amazon deals, good reads, audible, New Stand, Maps, Offers, Shop Amazon, and several other apps, but you can't they are locked down. I figured there has to be a way to remove the ads, well there is. Pay amazon 15.00 to enroll in the service to remove the ads from the device. WOW is all I can say.  After being a Prime member for over 6 years, I am really starting to reach that "Enough is enough" point. The bottom line is, spend the extra 50.00 and buy a real tablet. It will save you a lot of money in the long run because your child won't go to the "SHOP" home screen and order you a bunch of stuff on your behalf when you see 3 delivery trucks roll up outside your window, 14 new newsstand subscriptions in the mail, a 6 year audible membership, and 145 amazon prime movie purchases, all thanks to the quick and easy home screen layout.	10 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	Michael W	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1

NOT an improvement over previous generations	I've had a Kindle Fire (5th Generation) for several years and have been generally happy with it, so I expected the Kindle Fire 7 (9th Generation) to perform at least as well, especially for 4X the internal storage (32GB). I was wrong: the Fire 7 runs very slowly, frequently freezes, crashes out of apps, and doesn't appear to recognize the 64GB microSD card I use for storing books. It also does not "play well" with Amazon's own website and servers: most of my books are checked out through the public library, and even though the Fire 7 is designated the "default" device for downloading my books, the books are not downloading to the device, but are downloading to my old Fire. Thank heavens I kept my old Fire and traded in an extra Kindle for the Fire 7, as the Fire 7 is going back for replacement.	19 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	dtjacobson	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
Loved the color and that’s it	Battery doesn’t hold a charge- at all.  Not impressed that ads pop up on the lock screen and cost $ to remove. Comes with a full screen of factory apps that cannot be deleted. Only works with amazon apps so no chrome cast. Really wished I could have kept around for web and reading but have to return due to battery defect.	11 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Plum Style: Fire 7		Yes	MORNINGSTARR	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
Can't get kindle to take my password which I know is correct.	Live chatted with their "experts" for over an hour. They had me check the date, time which I told them I couldn't get to.  They had me turning off and restarting wi-fi and kindle.  the last one gave me instructions to go into Windows. While going from his chat  notes  to my computer, he typed ": I don't mean to rush you, but we've been idle for 2 minute. "  WOW.  So now I am trying to figure it out myself because I wasted over an hour with people who knew no more than me!	15 Jun 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Sage Style: Fire 7		Yes	LOLA STEGALL	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
Ads ads ads ads .	Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I should have done more research. I got this 2019 fire 7 on prime day for $29.99 and thought it would be cool to keep by the bedside for reading books. I did NOT realize it came with ads on the lock screen. The item description is deceptive. It says with “special offers.” I thought that meant it was on sale for prime day lol. Special offers is a play on words. They meant ADS. Special offers = ads!	22 Jul 2019	Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GB Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported Color: Black Style: Fire 7		Yes	RAM	1.0	Fire 7 tablet, 7" display, 16 GB, latest model (2019 release), Black	https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
